## Updates Since Last Meeting

### Visa Constraints
- Tapiwa is on an H-1B visa — restricted to working only for his current hospital (now at Oregon Health & Science University, previously Cincinnati)
- This limits his ability to be publicly associated with external ventures for now
- Rangarirai and Ernest have no such restrictions (US citizens / non-US based respectively)
- Agreement: Tapiwa can contribute behind the scenes until visa situation changes

### Market Landscape
- Ernest researched the genomics space in Africa — found virtually no competition
- Gates Foundation is actively pushing genomics funding, including mosquito genomics
- A group in Zimbabwe is doing pharmacogenomics work, supported by Gates Foundation
- Very little training in medical genetics across Africa — major gap

### Ernest's Status
- Recently completed his DrPH program — described as mentally intensive
- Currently not formally employed — available to dedicate time to this venture
- Committed to doing research, building the website, and driving momentum

## Key Discussion Topics

### 1. Genomics Skills Transferability
- Question raised: can skills in one genomics area (e.g., mosquito, plant) transfer to human genomics?
- Ngonidzashe has experience with Drosophila (fruit fly) genetics
- Consensus: the analytical/bioinformatics skills are highly transferable across organisms
- Key difference: human genomics requires clinical interpretation — understanding how mutations affect disease, treatment, and management
- The team collectively covers this gap (Tapiwa for clinical interpretation, others for analysis)

### 2. Scope of Opportunity Beyond Pharmacogenomics
Tapiwa outlined multiple areas where genetic testing is needed in Africa:

| Area | Opportunity |
|---|---|
| Cancer genetics | In the US, genetic testing for every cancer patient drives 90%+ 5-year survival; in Africa it's ~30% due to blanket chemo without genetic guidance |
| Neonatal genetics | 30-40% of neonates in ICU have underlying genetic conditions |
| Prenatal/miscarriage | 60%+ of first-trimester miscarriages are caused by genetic conditions |
| Breast cancer screening | Women under 40-45 with breast cancer or recurrent cancers should get genetic testing (BRCA1/BRCA2) |
| Newborn screening | Expanded screening programs needed across Africa |
| Autism & neurodevelopmental | Genetic component often undiagnosed |

**Tapiwa's view:** "Everything here is low-hanging fruit in Africa. Just get started on anything."

### 3. Quality Improvement (QI) Project Path
Rangarirai proposed a validated path to market:

1. **Find an in-house champion** at a US academic hospital (Tapiwa at OHSU)
2. **Frame it as a QI project** — hospitals are motivated and funded to do these
3. **Use retrospective patient data** — no clinical trial needed, uses existing records
4. **Build the AI/interpretation model** on real-world data with clinician validation (human in the loop)
5. **Publish in high-impact journals** (JAMA, NEJM) — builds credibility
6. **Migrate from hospital tool to commercial product** — proven, validated, published

- Tapiwa confirmed this is doable at OHSU — needs a project proposal and co-investigators
- The company could be listed as an **industry partner** providing the technology
- Estimated funding needed: $100K-$200K for a comprehensive protocol
- Timeline: could be done in ~6 months

### 4. Polypharmacy / Deprescribing Engine
- Rangarirai is also exploring a QI project focused on **geriatric polypharmacy** (patients on 5+ drugs)
- Would involve a **deprescribing engine** — AI-powered tool to identify unnecessary medications
- Plans to approach a geriatrician in his area
- Related but distinct from the PGx interpretation work

### 5. Equipment & Lab Setup Costs
Tapiwa provided cost context:

| Item | US Cost | Africa Cost (estimated) |
|---|---|---|
| Single gene test (e.g., sickle cell) | $200-300 | ~$100 or less |
| Sanger sequencing machine (basic) | ~$5,000 | Same |
| Larger NGS instrument (multi-cancer panels) | Higher | Same |
| Lab technologist hourly rate | High (US salaries) | <$5-10/hour |

- New sequencing technology is making instruments cheaper (~$5,000 entry point)
- Tapiwa to share link to the instrument he found
- Key insight: **funding removes cost from patients initially**, allowing the team to build proof and awareness before charging

### 6. Biobanking as a Revenue Stream
- If DNA extraction is done on the ground in Africa, samples can be stored as a **biobank**
- Biobanks generate revenue: pharmaceutical companies and researchers buy samples for drug development and mutation studies
- In the US, samples must be destroyed after a project; in Africa, the team controls the samples

### 7. Sample Logistics
- Blood samples stable at room temperature for up to 72 hours
- For longer transit: extract DNA on the ground in Africa, then ship extracted DNA (stable on ice for months/years)
- Preference: extract DNA locally — builds local capacity and creates the biobank

### 8. Gates Foundation Engagement
- Rather than just researching online, the team agreed to **request a direct conversation** with a Gates Foundation representative
- Tapiwa to send the initial email — framing it as: "We are exploring a research project with partners in Africa, we'd like to discuss scope and potential support"
- Ernest and Rangarirai to prepare the research brief first so the outreach speaks to what Gates cares about
- Ernest committed to completing this research within 1-2 days

### 9. Website & Formalisation
- Ernest to create a website (test site first, then refine)
- Company registration to follow once the team agrees on the entry point
- LinkedIn page planned for sharing ideas and building visibility
- Once formal: consistent content sharing and thought leadership

### 10. Tanzania Connection
- Tapiwa met a Tanzanian pathologist at a conference who is interested in genetics for pathology but said "we don't have the expertise"
- Tapiwa to share her contact with Ernest
- Ernest to connect with her to test the market and explore collaboration

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Don't limit to pharmacogenomics** — position as a genomics expertise company that can cover cancer, neonatal, prenatal, pharmacogenomics, and more
2. **Africa first for impact** — competition is virtually zero; immediate impact possible. US work runs in parallel via QI projects
3. **Get started on anything** — the specific entry point matters less than building momentum and proof
4. **Dual approach:** QI project in the US (validation + publication) AND pilot project in Africa (impact + proof of concept)
5. **Funding first model** — use grants to subsidize initial testing, build awareness, then transition to paid services

## Resources Shared During the Call

Shared by Ngonidzashe:

1. **AMP Body of Knowledge for Clinical Bioinformaticians**
   https://www.amp.org/clinical-practice/body-of-knowledge-for-the-clinical-bioinformatician/
   — Association for Molecular Pathology's framework defining essential bioinformatics roles, responsibilities, and competencies for clinical molecular diagnostic labs. A three-part series covering molecular diagnostics, bioinformatics pipelines, and regulatory/data security requirements. Published in *The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics*.

2. **Oxford Nanopore MinION Sequencer**
   https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/minion
   — Portable, affordable (~$5K) sequencing device. This is the instrument Tapiwa referenced as a low-cost entry point for setting up genetic testing in Africa. Small form factor, capable of real-time sequencing.

3. **"Clinical Opportunities for Germline Pharmacogenetics and Management of Drug-Drug Interactions in Patients With Advanced Solid Cancers"**
   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35201852/
   — Shugg et al., *JCO Precision Oncology*, 2022. Study of 481 cancer patients showing ~60% received medications with pharmacogenetic implications, ~40% had opportunities for precision medicine interventions, and only 14% had actionable PGx instances addressed. Directly supports the team's argument that there is a massive gap between available genetic data and clinical action — the exact problem PGx Clinical Solutions aims to solve.
