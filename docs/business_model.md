---

## 11. Regulatory Considerations

### Current Framework
- PGx interpretation reports are classified as **clinical decision support (CDS)**
- Under 21st Century Cures Act, certain CDS is exempt from FDA device regulation if:
  - Intended to enable clinicians to independently review basis for recommendations
  - Does not replace clinical judgment
  - Provides evidence sources and confidence levels

### Compliance Requirements
- **HIPAA**: All patient data handling must meet Privacy and Security Rules
- **CLIA**: Laboratory partner must have appropriate CLIA certification
- **State regulations**: Some states have specific PGx reporting requirements
- **Clinical validity**: Variant-drug associations must have established clinical validity (FDA table, CPIC, PharmGKB)

### Risk Mitigation
- Clear disclaimers that reports support (not replace) clinical judgment
- Evidence level transparency (CPIC A vs. B vs. C)
- Regular clinical advisory board review
- Audit trail for all report generation
- Version control for knowledge base updates
